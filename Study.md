# Introduction to Command Line Interface: Study

As a developer, you're going to spend a lot of time on the terminal using the command-line interface to set up your projects, managing your code, running servers, deploying your websites, and a lot more. So it only makes sense for you to get a head start with it.

In case you are wondering “what is a command-line interface?”, I would say, it’s a developer's best friend! But, that’s just me!

We’re all used to interacting with a computer using a graphical user interface by pointing and clicking or touching stuff on a screen. The command-line interface (or CLI for short) is pretty much the same thing except, in place of a graphical interface, we type out what we want the computer to do.

**If you are using a Mac or Linux operating system,** then you already have a working command-line environment you can use.

**If you're using Windows 10,** then you're going to need to do a few things before you can get started. Follow the instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-atblwgc63E) till the 3:25 marker or read the instructions in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps) to set up a Linux subsystem on Windows 10 for you. So you can also use the command-line interface.
