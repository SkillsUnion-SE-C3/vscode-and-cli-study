# Introduction to Command Line Interface: Study

As a developer, you're going to spend a lot of time on the terminal using the command-line interface to set up your projects, managing your code, running servers, deploying your websites, and a lot more. So it only makes sense for you to get a head start with it.

In case you are wondering “what is a command-line interface?”, I would say, it’s a developer's best friend! But, that’s just me!

We’re all used to interacting with a computer using a graphical user interface by pointing and clicking or touching stuff on a screen. The command-line interface (or CLI for short) is pretty much the same thing except, in place of a graphical interface, we type out what we want the computer to do.

Note: VSCode videos recommend turning on Auto Save and setting format on type and format on paste
Try starting out without auto save and use format on save instead. 

Later you can try auto save with format on type and see how you like it.
